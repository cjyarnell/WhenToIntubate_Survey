The statistical analysis is contained in the WhenToIntubate_analysis.R file.

The translate.R file includes a function for translating survey responses back to English, because they come from the REDCap database in the language that the respondent used.

We include our analysis plan here for transparency (also can be found on Open Science Framework https://osf.io/kfnpm).
